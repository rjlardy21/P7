/**
 * This class contains methods to parse text, specifically intended to eventually parse CSV (comma separated values) 
 * files. 
 * 
 * Definitions of Terms: 
 * delimiter: The character used to specify the boundary between fields in a sequence of characters.
 *            for example, the comma would be the delimiter between the fields:  
 *              name, id, section
 *            Note the field values include the spaces. In general, the field value is every character except
 *            for the delimiter.
 *            
 * qualifier: If a field value contains a delimiter such as a comma with the name field: 
 *              John Doe, MD, 1234567, 321
 *            then a qualifier, such as ", is placed around a field value to indicate it is the same field.
 *            for example: 
 *              "John Doe, MD", 1234567, 321
 *            If the qualifier itself is a part of the field value then the qualifier is duplicated.
 *            for example for the field value:
 *              H. Jackson Brown, Jr. said "The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today."
 *            would be enclosed with " and internal quotes duplicated resulting in the qualified field value:
 *              "H. Jackson Brown, Jr. said ""The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today."""
 *              
 *            A example with , as delimiter and " as qualifier with a newline \n in a field value should be 
 *            processed as follows:
 *              "This is a\nline of text.",bbb,ccc
 *            would have 3 fields
 *              "This is a\nline of text."
 *              bbb
 *              ccc
 *              
 * This project is derived from RFC 4180: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180
 *

    /**
     * This method returns the array of string containing the field values.
     * The field values in text are identified using , as the delimiter.
     * Qualifiers are not considered at all in the parsing of text.
     * 
     * Example:
     *   aaa,bbb,ccc

     *   aaa
     *   bbb
     *   ccc

     *   aaa,bbb,
     * should also result in an array with 3 fields with the 3rd field containing either whitespace or no spaces
     * depending on the actual characters after the last ,.
     * 
     * If text is null then a zero length array is returned. If text is non-null
     * but no delimiters are found then a single length array is returned with the text as the field value.
     * 
     * @param text  A sequence of characters that may include , as a delimiter.
     * @return An array of String containing each field value.  The size of the
     *    array is the number of fields found.
